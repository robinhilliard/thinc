# ThinC(lient)

Like Elm but with a Server-side virtual DOM in Elixir communicating with the browser over a websocket.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `thinc` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:thinc, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```
